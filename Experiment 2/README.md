Experiment 2 is me discovering the use of sound as well as light in these small circuit experiments. We were given small speakers and given advice on how they could be coded and then I went from there. I chose a tune and through research, iteration and example code I was able to run code that spit out a small tune through the speaker. 

A photo of the set up and video of it working are here: Experiment 2\Media

The code I used to make it actually work resides here: Experiment 2\Code\Speaker code.jpeg
