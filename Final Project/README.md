The idea for my final project was relatively simple. 

My final project explores the use of environmental sensing and lighting to create an ambient mood light, provisionally titled "LuminAura." The core concept revolves around a physical computing system that dynamically adjusts its light output, specifically its color, in direct response to the light conditions of its environment.

At its heart, the project utilizes a simple combination of a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a multi-color RGB LED. The LDR will serve as the sensory input, measuring the intensity of light present in the room. This analog light data will then be translated by a microcontroller into specific color outputs from the RGB LED. The goal is to establish a natural correlation: as ambient light diminishes, the LED will shift through a predefined spectrum of colors, perhaps moving from cooler, brighter tones in well-lit conditions to warmer, deeper, and more saturated hues as darkness falls. Conversely, an increase in ambient light would trigger a return to lighter colours.

The porject is roughly inspired by students I have spoken to who feel a light when they are working can be a nice thing to have when distracting them.
