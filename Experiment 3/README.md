Experiment 3 was my introduction to LED strips - to be more specific Adafruit NeoPixel LED strips. These fascinated me due to the different amounts of things I could do with them.
My task was to turn them on and see if I could get all the lights working to shine bright white as my first experiment. 

As shown in my media folder you can see the image of the NeoPixel strip being on. Experiment 3\Media\LED strip lights up.jpeg

As well as the video showing the wya it lit up each light individually which was cool. Experiment 3\Media\LED strip lights up bright white.mp4

Shown here is the code too, it is easy to read and shows how the brightness and other things like that are initialized and shown.
