Experiment 4 was Moving on from just white and accessing different colours through dipping into researching the RGB fields and seeing what colours I could come up with besides white.

It was more artistic than experimental but taught me how to maniplate the RGB fields in a way that could help me later on.

The code for pure green and purple are here. Experiment 4\Code\LED-strip-green-code\LED-strip-green-code.ino
Experiment 4\Code\LED-strip-Purple-Code\LED-strip-Purple-Code.ino

My media showing that I was able to acutally do this is here. Experiment 4\Media

I was able to find out which RGB digits corresponded to different colours through experimentation, iteration and trial and error and by the end I was looking at a colour wheel and deciding which colours came from where and trialing those digits based on that. It was some of the most fun I had during this module.
