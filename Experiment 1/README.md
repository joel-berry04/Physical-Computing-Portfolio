Experiment 1 for me was the beginning of this journey, it all began with the making lights flick on and off and the workings of how it connected together.

It is the typical blink set up that can be found in Arduino IDE but it served as an introduction for me into how I could design different experiments. 

Shown here is my video of blink working as intended with 1000ms (one second) intervals. (Experiment 1\Media\Blink.mp4). 

Shown here is the code as well, it is example code but was adapted by me during the course of experimentation to have different intervals between the 'LEDBUILTIN' being high or low to signify on and off. Experiment 1\Code\Blink.ino
