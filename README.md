# Physical-Computing-Portfolio
My Physical computing portfolio with a final project and report

Welcome to my physical computing portfolio. This repository is documentation of my journey through various physical computing experiments and the development of a final project. As outlined in the module brief, this portfolio aims to showcase a sequence of technical investigations, from foundation experiments to a more ambitious, self-chosen application.

Throughout these entries, you'll find detailed accounts of my experiments, including circuit diagrams, code, component breakdowns, and troubleshooting insights. My goal is to communicate these investigations clearly and efficiently.
