Experiment 5: 
Next I tried to control where on the LED strip one light would be using a potentiometer. Using a potentiometer was very fun once it eventually worked and rlly helped with mu understanding of how the compoents fitted together. The components used were the Arduino Board, jumper cables to connect power, the LED strip, resistors and a potentiometer. Some issues I had was the lights were flickering between different lights rather than staying at one, which I had a video of, by adding certain bits of code like NUM_PIXELS -1, it tended to be more and more accurate. 

My first try looked like this: Experiment 5\Media\LED strip potentiometer beginning.mp4 
As mentioned before you can see how its not totally accurate. 

After some trial and error I was able to make it slightly better as shown here: Experiment 5\Media\LED strip potentiometer almost working.mp4

As you can see its more accuurate but not totally so I had to keep trying, you can also see the amounts its moving is not a lot as well because unknown to me at the time, you had to initialize the number of pixels within the strip. This also came from mosrlty trial and error and my final guess is about 124 different LEDs which seemed the most correct when running it.

Finally after all the trial and error Inwas able to control the lights exactly and the whole thing was abke to be reached by the turn of the potentiometer. This is shown here: Experiment 5\Media\LED strip potentiometer work.mp4
